# Line-Follower
Line Follower Robot using Arduino Uno, L293D, N20 Motors, and QTR-8 Sensors ‚Äî with smooth PID control and junction detection for competition-ready tracking.
# üõ£Ô∏è Line Follower Robot (Arduino Uno + QTR-8 + L293D + N20 Motors)

This is a high-performance **line-following robot** built using an **Arduino Uno**, an **L293D motor driver**, and a **QTR-8A analog IR sensor array**. It uses a custom **PID control algorithm** to follow black lines on white surfaces and includes support for **junction detection** like T-junctions, crossroads, and left/right splits.

Perfect for competitions or learning about autonomous robotics!

##  Software & Libraries

- Arduino IDE
- `QTRSensors` library for sensor calibration
- Custom PID logic (no motor shield libraries used)

---

## üèÅ Track Specifications

- Line color: **Black**
- Surface: **White**
- Line width: **Approximately 3cm**
- Includes: **Turns, T-junctions, crossroads**

---

##  How It Works

1. The QTR-8 sensor reads reflected IR light from the surface.
2. Analog values are used to calculate the line‚Äôs position.
3. A PID algorithm adjusts left and right motor speeds accordingly.
4. Additional logic handles junctions and intersections.
